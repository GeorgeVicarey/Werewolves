    <p>Shamelessly stolen from Pads post from StratLAN.<br>Original  Game - Werewolves of Millers Hollow (The Pact)</p>
<h1 id="What-is-Werewolves"><a href="#What-is-Werewolves" class="headerlink" title="What is Werewolves?"></a>What is Werewolves?</h1><p>This is a social game involving cards that is very easy to learn and fun to play. Usually played outside BYOC, or in the social games area. </p>
<h1 id="Who-organizes-it"><a href="#Who-organizes-it" class="headerlink" title="Who organizes it?"></a>Who organizes it?</h1><p>It’s normally myself, or Henners. Though there are a fair few people who play, and will organise games.</p>
<h1 id="A-simple-explanation"><a href="#A-simple-explanation" class="headerlink" title="A simple explanation"></a>A simple explanation</h1><p>All players sit in a circle and each player is given a single card at random by the moderator. They will look at this card, remember it and then place it face down in front of them. </p>
<p>The card you have will determine your team. Your team will be either werewolves or villagers. It is the villagers job to find and kill all the werewolves, and it is the werewolves job to eat all the villagers. Either way you win or lose as a team, the tricky part is you don’t know who is on your team and who is not. </p>
<p>The game progresses with phases, with each phase lasting a few minutes. The phases are called day and night. </p>
<h1 id="Night-Phase"><a href="#Night-Phase" class="headerlink" title="Night Phase"></a>Night Phase</h1><p>During the night phase, all players will remain silent and close their eyes. The werewolves will be asked by the moderator to “wake up” (i.e Open their eyes in silence) and then point to the person they wish to eat. Their vote must be unanimous. They then close their eyes again as if nothing happened. The game opens with a night phase. If you open your eyes without being explicitly asked by the moderator, you will be mod-killed and removed from the game.</p>
<h1 id="Day-Phase"><a href="#Day-Phase" class="headerlink" title="Day Phase"></a>Day Phase</h1><p>During the day phase, all players will discuss who they think are werewolves and vote on a single person to be lynched. This is done by the village making a number of nominations. It’s normally 3, but when fewer people are left, it is often dropped to 2. Once all nominations have been made, each nominee will be permitted to defend themself. A majority vote is then taken by the Moderator.</p>
<p>That is generally how the game progresses, each player upon being lynched or eaten will reveal their card to the group (in silence) and then will no longer participate in the game. The game ends when all werewolves or villagers are dead. </p>
<h1 id="The-Fun-Part"><a href="#The-Fun-Part" class="headerlink" title="The Fun Part"></a>The Fun Part</h1><p>There are a few more roles than just simple villager, or werewolf.<br>These roles are selected, balanced, and distributed by the moderator before starting the game.</p>
<h1 id="Role-List"><a href="#Role-List" class="headerlink" title="Role List"></a>Role List</h1><ul>
<li>Villager<br>This is a simple villager. You are awake during the day, and you sleep through the night.</li>
<li>Werewolf<br>The enemy of the village. You want to eat every villager, and win the game.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Pro-Village-cards"><a href="#Pro-Village-cards" class="headerlink" title="Pro-Village cards"></a>Pro-Village cards</h1><ul>
<li>Hunter<br>The hunter is armed with a single shot. When the hunter dies, they immediately shoot someone by pointing with them. You may not discuss who to shoot.<br>Wake up in the night: No<br>Very common</li>
<li>Seer<br>The seer wakes up in the night and is asked to choose a person to see the card of. The moderator then reveals their card.<br>Wake up in the night: Yes<br>Very common</li>
<li>Elder<br>The elder has seen a werewolf before. They have two lives against wolf kills.<br>If the village lynches the elder during the day phase, all pro-village power roles listed here become inert and may no longer use their powers.<br>Wake up in the night: Maybe, mod discretion.<br>Common</li>
<li>Defender<br>The defender wakes up in the night, and selects one person to protect from the werewolves. You may not choose the same person twice in a row, and you may choose to defend yourself.<br>Wake up in the night: Yes.<br>Very common</li>
<li>Witch<br>The witch has two potions. A save potion, and a kill potion. They may only use each once per game.<br>The person targetted by the werewolves is revealed, and the witch is asked if they would like to save them. They either nod their head, or shake their head to signal. They may only save someone once per game.<br>The witch is then asked if they would like to kill anyone. If so, they silently point. If not, they shake their head. They may only kill someone once per game.<br>Wake up in the night: Yes<br>Very common</li>
<li>Cupid<br>Cupid awakes only once, during the very first night phase.<br>Cupid selects two players to fall in love. The two players are tapped on the head, and are asked to wake up. They then reveal their cards to each other.<br>If one of the lovers dies, the other lover also dies.<br>If the lovers are of the same team (Village-Village or Werewolf-Werewolf), then no additional team is created.<br>If the lovers are a combination of Villager / Werewolf, they immediately form a third, additional team with the win condition of being the last two players left alive. This is very difficult to accomplish, but is incredibly fulfilling when it occurs.<br>Wake up in the night: No, only the first night phase.<br>Common</li>
<li>Thief (Mode 1)<br>The thief is presented with a set of 3 cards, from which they may choose one.<br>That becomes their new role, and replaces their thief card in front of them.<br>Wake up in the night: No<br>Rare</li>

<li>Twin Sisters<br>Same as the Three Brothers, except there are two. (Unless Nanaki is playing, in which case there is only one. &lt;3 u)<br>Wake up in the night: Yes<br>Uncommon</li>
